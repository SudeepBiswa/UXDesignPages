                and combos, managing SP efficiently, building stagger on enemies, and setting up elemental or status effects. Players switch characters during combat to keep pressure, survive, and 
                clear stages successfully.">Objectives</a></li>
            <li><a href="#" data-header="BENEFITS" data-paragraph="The combat system rewards players with a sense of skill when they successfully time their dodges, do combos, and set up elemental 
                reactions. The players are able to enjoy the fast, real-time combat and the feeling of using a full team effectively. Progressing characters and improving team setups gives players a 
                sense of growth and achievement. Many of the players also enjoy sharing strategies and discussing combat techniques within the community.">Benefits</a></li>
            <li><a href="#" data-header="DIFFICULTIES" data-paragraph="Players tend to struggle with the learning curve that SP management brings, combo timing, and elemental interactions. Combat can 
                feel repetitive if players do not fully engage with the system’s deeper mechanics. Sometimes the AI controlling the teammates can make poor positioning or targeting choices, which can 
                cause frustration in the harder fights. New players can also feel oberwhelmed by the system's complexity, making it harder to stay engaged early in the game.">Difficulties</a></li>
